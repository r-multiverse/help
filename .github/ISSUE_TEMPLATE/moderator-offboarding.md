@r-multiverse/administrators, I would like to leave the R-multiverse [moderator](https://r-multiverse.org/team.html#moderators) team.

## Offboarding process

- [ ] An [administrator](https://r-multiverse.org/team.html#administrators) will remove you from the [R-multiverse moderator GitHub team](https://github.com/orgs/r-multiverse/teams/moderators).
- [ ] An [administrator](https://r-multiverse.org/team.html#administrators) will move you from the [moderator list](https://github.com/r-multiverse/r-multiverse.github.io/blob/main/team.md#moderators) to the [alumni list](https://github.com/r-multiverse/r-multiverse.github.io/blob/main/team.md#alumni) on the [team page](https://github.com/r-multiverse/r-multiverse.github.io/blob/main/team.md).
