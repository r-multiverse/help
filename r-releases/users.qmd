## How to install a package from R-releases

Simply add R-releases to your repository settings:

```r
options(repos = c("https://r-releases.r-universe.dev", getOption("repos")))
```

R natively supports multiple repositories as a core language feature, and the above only needs to be set once per session. We recommend adding it to your `.Rprofile` so that it is always available.

Alternatively, to prioritize CRAN over R-releases:

```r
options(repos = c(getOption("repos"), "https://r-releases.r-universe.dev"))
```

Then proceed to use `install.packages()` as you would normally.

## Ensuring your package is always available

R-releases is designed to work seamlessly alongside CRAN. By prioritizing CRAN in the settings above, you can choose to still get your packages from CRAN, only using R-releases as a fall-back.

For any number of possible reasons, a package may become unavailable on CRAN at any time due to its strict archival policy. 

- Often due to archival of a strong dependency (which automatically archives all of its reverse depedencies at short notice) and is outside of the maintainer's control.
- Situations can be temporary, but may take an extended time to resolve.

By [contributing](contributors.html) a package that you rely on, you can ensure that it remains available for your critical workflows.

## Faster updates direct from maintainers

Maintainers may choose to use R-releases as a faster release channel, especially for packages under intensive development. 

CRAN is first and foremost an archival network, and its policy restricts the frequency of package updates. R-releases allows the timely dissemination of newer package versions containing critical updates or bug fixes.

If a package maintainer recommends you to install a package from R-releases, please prioritize R-releases in front of CRAN in the repository settings above.
