R-releases is a community-curated, maintainer-driven repository of R package releases.

Anyone can contribute packages in the GitHub repository at <https://github.com/r-releases/r-releases>. Once a package is registered, [R-universe](https://r-universe.dev/) automatically builds and checks every new release and makes it available to install from <https://r-releases.r-universe.dev/>. Package maintainers have complete control over deployment.

The R-releases effort originated from the [R Consortium Repositories Working Group](https://github.com/RConsortium/r-repositories-wg).
