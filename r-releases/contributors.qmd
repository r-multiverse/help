The [code of conduct](https://github.com/r-releases/help/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) governs all forms of participation in the R-releases project, including package contributions, issues, discussions, and the development of infrastructure. Administrators, moderators, and contributors are all subject to its terms.

## How to register your package with R-releases

The one-time registration process proceeds as follows:

1. Ensure that the package source code exists in a public [GitHub](https://github.com) or [GitLab](https://gitlab.com) repository with the `DESCRIPTION` file at the root of the project. Example: <https://github.com/r-lib/gh>.
2. Ensure that the package has a [release](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository) for the latest production version of your package. Example: <https://github.com/r-lib/gh/releases/tag/v1.4.0>.
3. Open a [GitHub pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) to <https://github.com/r-releases/r-releases> to contribute one or more text files to the [`packages` folder](https://github.com/r-releases/r-releases/tree/main/packages) with R package listings.

The overwhelming majority of text files in (3) will be in simple URL format, which has has 3 requirements:

1. The name of the file is the package name.
2. The file contains a single line with the package URL. The URL must be authentic and genuine. It must be the true GitHub/GitLab location of the package according to its owners, or an active mirror of the true location.
3. The file ends with a [newline character](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/729692/why-should-text-files-end-with-a-newline). (A terminating newline is included automatically if you create the file using the GitHub web interface.)

In rare cases, the package may be in a subdirectory of a GitHub repo, in which case the contents of your text file may be a JSON list with fields `package`, `url`, `subdir`, and `branch`, and the `branch` field must be `"*release"`. [Example](https://github.com/r-releases/r-releases/blob/main/packages/paws.analytics):

```json
{
  "package": "paws.analytics",
  "url": "https://github.com/paws-r/paws",
  "subdir": "cran/paws.analytics",
  "branch": "*release"
}
```

To add a dynamic 'R-releases' badge for package readme files, like the one above, copy the following markdown snippet, replacing 'pkgNAME' with the actual package name in both places it appears:

```md
[![R-releases status](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?url=https%3A%2F%2Fr-releases.r-universe.dev%2Fapi%2Fpackages%2FpkgNAMEquery=%24.Version&label=R-releases)](https://r-releases.r-universe.dev/pkgNAME)
```

## How to edit or remove packages

To edit or remove one or more packages, submit a pull request to edit the files in the [`packages`](https://github.com/r-releases/r-releases/tree/main/packages) folder. To protect the package ecosystem, these kinds of pull requests are always flagged for manual review and never automatically merged.

## How pull requests are reviewed

An automated process periodically scans each new pull request to https://github.com/r-releases/r-releases. Depending on the results of the automated checks, the bot automatically merges the pull request, closes it, or flags it for manual review. In the latter case, an R-releases moderator will manually review your pull request and contact you if there are questions. For more information on the manual review process and when it gets triggered, please visit <https://github.com/r-releases/help/blob/main/review.md>

## How the R-releases universe is built

Periodically, a GitHub Actions workflow collects all the packages and URLs from the [`packages`](https://github.com/r-releases/r-releases/tree/main/packages) folder and builds the `packages.json` file for the universe at <https://github.com/r-releases/r-releases.r-universe.dev>. <https://r-releases.r-universe.dev> periodically refreshes to include the latest release of each package in `packages.json`.

## Ownership and attribution

Each submitted package URL must be authentic and genuine. The URL must be the true location of the package according to its true owners. If a URL in https://github.com/r-releases/r-releases/tree/main/packages points to the wrong place, please submit a pull request to <https://github.com/r-releases/r-releases> to fix the URL. If you do not know the correct URL or do not want to submit a pull request, please open an issue at <https://github.com/r-releases/help/issues>.

## Getting help

Please report bugs to <https://github.com/r-releases/help/issues> and send other feedback and questions to <https://github.com/r-releases/help/discussions>. Please note that <https://github.com/r-releases/r-releases> can only accept pull requests to add or modify package entries.
